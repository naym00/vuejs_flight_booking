This Project is basically a flight booking project.
An user can select his or her Starting location and Destination and date also.
Whenever he/she will Press "Find Flight" button then it will show the weather data of destination location.

## This data has been sectioned into 4 sections.
###### Morning Temperature: Basically morning temperature is average temperature of 5 AM to 11 AM.
###### Afternoon Temperature: Afternoon temperature is average temperature of 12 PM to 5 PM.
###### Evening Temperature: Evening temperature is average temperature of 6 PM to 9 PM.
###### Overnight Temperature: Overnight temperature is average temperature of 10 PM to 4 AM.

## For the Humidity update i have also maintained same logic. 
###### Morning Humidity: Basically morning humidity is average humidity of 5 AM to 11 AM.
###### Afternoon Humidity: Afternoon humidity is average humidity of 12 PM to 5 PM.
###### Evening Humidity: Evening humidity is average humidity of 6 PM to 9 PM.
###### Overnight Humidity: Overnight humidity is average humidity of 10 PM to 4 AM.
